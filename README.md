# Responsive navbar
In this project, I created responsive navbar. It is simple but usefull project. There are cutting edge tech i use in this project.
* Vite react
* use state
* use Ref
* css
* nanoId
* react icons
## Vite React
* React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage their state efficiently. React uses a declarative approach, making it easier to understand and debug complex UIs.
* Vite: Vite is a modern build tool for frontend development. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and developer-friendly. Vite supports various frontend frameworks, including React, Vue.js, and Preact. Unlike traditional bundlers like Webpack, Vite leverages native ES module imports for faster development and builds.
## Use State

* useState is a React hook that allows functional components to manage their own state. It returns a state variable and a function to update that variable. This enables functional components to store and update data internally, making them more versatile and powerful.
## Use Ref
* useRef is a React hook used to create a mutable reference to a DOM element or any mutable value that persists across renders. It returns a mutable object with a current property, which can be assigned to the DOM element or any other value you want to persist between renders. It's commonly used for accessing and managing DOM elements in React functional components, or for storing mutable values that don't trigger re-renders.
## nanoId
*
nanoid is a small JavaScript library used to generate unique, URL-friendly IDs. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, and secure. Nanoid generates random IDs that are highly unlikely to collide, even in distributed systems or when generating a large number of IDs.

## Addition
const linksStyles = {
  height: showLinks
    ? `${linksRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().height}px`
    : '0px',
};
linksStyles: This is an object that holds CSS styles for an element.
height: This property defines the height of the element.
showLinks: This seems to be a boolean variable that determines whether to show the links. If showLinks is true, the height will be set to the height of the element referenced by linksRef. If showLinks is false, the height will be set to '0px', effectively hiding the element.
linksRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().height: This part calculates the height of the element referenced by linksRef. linksRef is likely a React ref pointing to the element whose height is being measured. getBoundingClientRect() is a method that returns the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport. height is then extracted from the returned object and appended with 'px' to form a valid CSS height value.
So, linksStyles is an object that dynamically sets the height of an element based on whether showLinks is true or false, using the height of another element as a reference. This is commonly used in React applications to implement dynamic UI behaviors.
